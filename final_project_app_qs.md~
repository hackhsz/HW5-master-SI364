# SI 364 - Final Project questions

## Overall

* **What's a one-two sentence description of what your app will do?**

## The Data

* **What data will your app use? From where will you get it? (e.g. scraping a site? what site? -- careful not to run it too much. An API? Which API?)**

* **What data will a user need to enter into a form?**

* **How many fields will your form have? What's an example of some data user might enter into it?**

* **After a user enters data into the form, what happens? Does that data help a user search for more data? Does that data get saved in a database? Does that determine what already-saved data the user should see?**

* **What models will you have in your application?**

* **What fields will each model have?**

* **What uniqueness constraints will there be on each table? (e.g. can't add a song with the same title as an existing song)**

* **What relationships will exist between the tables? What's a 1:many relationship between? What about a many:many relationship?**

* **How many get_or_create functions will you need? In what order will you invoke them? Which one will need to invoke at least one of the others?**

## The Pages

* **How many pages (routes) will your application have?**

* **How many different views will a user be able to see, NOT counting errors?**

* **Basically, what will a user see on each page / at each route? Will it change depending on something else -- e.g. they see a form if they haven't submitted anything, but they see a list of things if they have?**

## Extras

* **Why might your application send email?**

* **If you plan to have user accounts, what information will be specific to a user account? What can you only see if you're logged in? What will you see if you're not logged in -- anything?**

* **What are your biggest concerns about the process of building this application?**
